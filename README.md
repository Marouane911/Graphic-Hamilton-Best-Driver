In this project we will first analyze the Grand Prix won by all the drivers from 2012 to 2022, marking an unbalanced rivalry between Lewis Hamilton and the other drivers. Secondly, we'll look at the circuits where Lewis Hamilton has won the most Grand Prix. Thirdly, we'll look at Lewis Hamilton's race times, particularly in Great Britain, the United States, Italy, Canada and Hungary. We'll note that Lewis Hamilton won many more Grand Prix (around 70), most of them in Great Britain, but his best race times were at the Italian circuit, with a record of around 1 hour and 15 minutes. You'll find the dataset for this project [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakeshkudmulwar7/formula-1-race-winners-20122022).
